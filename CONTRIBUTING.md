## environment

I use **[nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)** to manage my node versions.

```bash
brew install nvm
```

## development setup

- create a fork of the repo, clone it, and install the dependencies

```bash
cd notion-renderer
nvm install
npm install
```

- run tests in watch mode

```bash
npm test
```
